      "backupLocation": true
    }
  ],
  "repositories": [
    "repo1",
    "repo2"
  ]
}
```

## Usage

### Command Structure

### Global Options

These options are available for all commands:

- `-c, --config` - Path to configuration file (default: ~/.config/gitsyncer/config.json)
- `-w, --work-dir` - Working directory (default: ~/git/gitsyncer-workdir)
- `-h, --help` - Show help for any command

## The --backup Flag

The `--backup` flag enables syncing to backup locations configured in your config file. This is particularly useful when:
- Your backup server might be offline (e.g., home NAS)
- You want to control when backups happen
- You need to separate regular syncing from backup operations

Without `--backup`: GitSyncer only syncs between primary git hosts (GitHub, Codeberg, etc.)
With `--backup`: GitSyncer also pushes to backup locations marked with `"backupLocation": true`

```bash
# Regular sync (backup locations ignored)
gitsyncer sync repo myrepo

# Sync with backup enabled
gitsyncer sync repo myrepo --backup
```

## How It Works

1. GitSyncer clones the repository from the first configured organization
2. Adds all other organizations as git remotes
3. For each branch:
   - Fetches from all remotes
   - Merges changes from remotes that have the branch
   - Pushes to all remotes (creating branches if needed)

## Branch Exclusion

You can exclude branches from synchronization using regex patterns in your configuration:

```json
{
  "organizations": [...],
  "repositories": [...],
  "exclude_branches": [
    "^codex/",    // Exclude branches starting with "codex/"
    "^temp-",     // Exclude branches starting with "temp-"
    "-wip$",      // Exclude branches ending with "-wip"
    "experimental" // Exclude branches containing "experimental"
  ]
}
```

Excluded branches will be reported during sync but not synchronized.

## SSH Backup Locations

You can configure SSH backup locations for one-way repository backups to private servers:

```json
{
  "organizations": [
    {
      "host": "git@github.com",
      "name": "yourusername"
    },
    {
      "host": "paul@t450:git",
      "backupLocation": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### How SSH Backup Works

1. **Opt-in feature**: Backup locations are disabled by default. Use the `--backup` flag to enable syncing to them
2. **One-way sync**: Repositories are only pushed TO backup locations, never pulled FROM them
3. **Automatic repository creation**: If a repository doesn't exist on the SSH server, GitSyncer will:
   - SSH into the server
   - Create the directory structure
   - Initialize a bare git repository
4. **Archive functionality**: Repositories that exist only on the backup location are considered archived and won't be synced to other organizations
5. **All branches and tags**: Every branch and tag is pushed to the backup location when `--backup` is used

### SSH Backup Example

```bash
# Configure your config file with an SSH backup location
# Backup locations are DISABLED by default to handle offline servers

# Sync without backup (default behavior)
gitsyncer sync repo myrepo

# Sync WITH backup enabled
gitsyncer sync repo myrepo --backup

# Sync all repositories with backup
gitsyncer sync all --backup

# Full sync with backup
gitsyncer sync bidirectional --backup
```

The backup location path format is: `user@host:path/REPONAME.git`
- `user@host`: SSH connection string
- `path`: Base directory for repositories
- `REPONAME.git`: Automatically appended repository name

**Note**: The `--backup` flag is required to sync to backup locations. This allows GitSyncer to work normally even when backup servers are offline or unreachable.

## Project Showcase Generation

GitSyncer can generate a comprehensive showcase of all your projects using Claude AI. This feature creates a formatted document with project summaries, statistics, and code snippets.

### How it works

1. **Repository Analysis**: GitSyncer analyzes all cloned repositories to extract:
   - Programming languages and their usage percentages
   - Commit history and development activity
   - Lines of code and documentation
   - License information
   - Latest release version and date
   - AI-assistance detection (looks for CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md files)

2. **AI-Powered Summaries**: Uses Claude AI to generate concise project descriptions that explain:
   - What the project does
   - Why it's useful
   - How it's implemented
   - Key features and architecture

3. **Automatic Features**:
   - Extracts README images (including SVG support)
   - Selects representative code snippets
   - Orders projects by recent activity
   - Generates overall portfolio statistics
   - Caches summaries to avoid redundant AI calls

### Usage

```bash
# Generate showcase (uses cached summaries when available)
gitsyncer showcase

# Force regeneration of all summaries
gitsyncer showcase --force

# Custom output path and format
gitsyncer showcase --output ~/showcase.md --format markdown
```

### Output

The showcase is generated in Gemini Gemtext format and includes:
- Overall statistics (total projects, commits, lines of code, languages)
- Release status breakdown (released vs experimental projects)
- AI-assistance statistics
- Individual project sections with:
  - Language breakdown
  - Development metrics
  - Latest release information or experimental status
  - Project description
  - Code snippet example
  - Links to repositories

### Configuration

The showcase output is written to `~/git/foo.zone-content/gemtext/about/showcase.gmi.tpl` by default (currently hardcoded).

Projects can be excluded from the showcase by creating a `.nosync` file in their repository root.

## Example Workflows

### Automated weekly synchronization
The batch-run feature is designed for automated weekly synchronization from cron jobs or shell scripts:

1. Add to your crontab or shell profile:
   ```bash
   # Run daily - gitsyncer will only execute once per week
   0 2 * * * /path/to/gitsyncer manage batch-run
   ```

2. On each run, GitSyncer will:
   - Check if a week has passed since the last batch run
   - If yes: Execute full sync and showcase generation
   - If no: Skip execution and show when the last run occurred
   - Save the timestamp to `.gitsyncer-state.json` in your work directory

3. Benefits:
   - Prevents excessive API usage
   - Can be safely called daily/hourly without worry
   - Maintains weekly sync cadence automatically
   - Shows state file location for debugging

### Sync specific repositories
1. Create repositories on all platforms (GitHub, Codeberg, etc.)
2. Add the repository name to your configuration file
3. Run `gitsyncer sync repo repo-name`
4. GitSyncer will:
   - Clone from the first organization
   - Push all branches to other organizations
   - Keep them in sync going forward

### Sync all public Codeberg repositories
1. Ensure Codeberg is in your organizations list in the config
2. Run `gitsyncer sync codeberg-to-github`
3. GitSyncer will:
   - Fetch all public repositories from your Codeberg account
   - Sync each one to all other configured organizations
   - Skip any that fail (e.g., don't exist on other platforms)

## Error Handling

- **Merge conflicts**: GitSyncer will detect conflicts and exit with an error message
- **Missing repositories**: Must be created manually on all platforms
- **Missing branches**: Automatically created on remotes that don't have them
