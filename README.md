# GitSyncer

GitSyncer is a tool for synchronizing git repositories between multiple organizations (e.g., GitHub and Codeberg). It automatically keeps all branches in sync across different git hosting platforms.

It has been vibe coded mainly using Claude Code CLI.

## Installation

```bash
go build -o gitsyncer ./cmd/gitsyncer
```

## Configuration

Create a `gitsyncer.json` file:

```json
{
  "organizations": [
    {
      "host": "git@codeberg.org",
      "name": "yourusername"
    },
    {
      "host": "git@github.com",
      "name": "yourusername"
    },
    {
      "host": "user@nas.local:git",
      "backupLocation": true
    }
  ],
  "repositories": [
    "repo1",
    "repo2"
  ]
}
```

## Usage

### Sync a single repository
```bash
./gitsyncer --sync repo-name

# Include backup locations
./gitsyncer --sync repo-name --backup
```

### Sync all configured repositories
```bash
./gitsyncer --sync-all

# Include backup locations
./gitsyncer --sync-all --backup
```

### Sync all public Codeberg repositories to GitHub
```bash
# Dry run - see what would be synced
./gitsyncer --sync-codeberg-public --dry-run

# Actually sync all public repos
./gitsyncer --sync-codeberg-public

# With automatic GitHub repo creation
./gitsyncer --sync-codeberg-public --create-github-repos
```

### Sync all public GitHub repositories to Codeberg
```bash
# Dry run - see what would be synced
./gitsyncer --sync-github-public --dry-run

# Actually sync all public repos
./gitsyncer --sync-github-public
```

### Full bidirectional sync
```bash
# Sync all public repos from both Codeberg and GitHub
# This enables --sync-codeberg-public --sync-github-public 
# --create-github-repos --create-codeberg-repos
./gitsyncer --full

# With dry run to see what would happen
./gitsyncer --full --dry-run
```

### Automated weekly batch run
```bash
# Run full sync with showcase generation, but only once per week
# This enables --full and --showcase with a weekly timer
./gitsyncer --batch-run

# The batch run state is saved to {workDir}/.gitsyncer-state.json
# Subsequent runs within 7 days will be skipped
```

### List configured organizations
```bash
./gitsyncer --list-orgs
```

### List configured repositories  
```bash
./gitsyncer --list-repos
```

### Show version
```bash
./gitsyncer --version
```

### Generate project showcase
```bash
# Generate a showcase of all your projects using Claude AI
./gitsyncer --showcase

# Force regeneration of cached summaries
./gitsyncer --showcase --force
```

### The --backup Flag

The `--backup` flag enables syncing to backup locations configured in your `gitsyncer.json`. This is particularly useful when:
- Your backup server might be offline (e.g., home NAS)
- You want to control when backups happen
- You need to separate regular syncing from backup operations

Without `--backup`: GitSyncer only syncs between primary git hosts (GitHub, Codeberg, etc.)
With `--backup`: GitSyncer also pushes to backup locations marked with `"backupLocation": true`

```bash
# Regular sync (backup locations ignored)
./gitsyncer --sync myrepo

# Sync with backup enabled
./gitsyncer --sync myrepo --backup
```

## How It Works

1. GitSyncer clones the repository from the first configured organization
2. Adds all other organizations as git remotes
3. For each branch:
   - Fetches from all remotes
   - Merges changes from remotes that have the branch
   - Pushes to all remotes (creating branches if needed)

## Branch Exclusion

You can exclude branches from synchronization using regex patterns in your configuration:

```json
{
  "organizations": [...],
  "repositories": [...],
  "exclude_branches": [
    "^codex/",    // Exclude branches starting with "codex/"
    "^temp-",     // Exclude branches starting with "temp-"
    "-wip$",      // Exclude branches ending with "-wip"
    "experimental" // Exclude branches containing "experimental"
  ]
}
```

Excluded branches will be reported during sync but not synchronized.

## SSH Backup Locations

You can configure SSH backup locations for one-way repository backups to private servers:

```json
{
  "organizations": [
    {
      "host": "git@github.com",
      "name": "yourusername"
    },
    {
      "host": "paul@t450:git",
      "backupLocation": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### How SSH Backup Works

1. **Opt-in feature**: Backup locations are disabled by default. Use the `--backup` flag to enable syncing to them
2. **One-way sync**: Repositories are only pushed TO backup locations, never pulled FROM them
3. **Automatic repository creation**: If a repository doesn't exist on the SSH server, GitSyncer will:
   - SSH into the server
   - Create the directory structure
   - Initialize a bare git repository
4. **Archive functionality**: Repositories that exist only on the backup location are considered archived and won't be synced to other organizations
5. **All branches and tags**: Every branch and tag is pushed to the backup location when `--backup` is used

### SSH Backup Example

```bash
# Configure your gitsyncer.json with an SSH backup location
# Backup locations are DISABLED by default to handle offline servers

# Sync without backup (default behavior)
./gitsyncer --sync myrepo

# Sync WITH backup enabled
./gitsyncer --sync myrepo --backup

# Sync all repositories with backup
./gitsyncer --sync-all --backup

# Full sync with backup
./gitsyncer --full --backup
```

The backup location path format is: `user@host:path/REPONAME.git`
- `user@host`: SSH connection string
- `path`: Base directory for repositories
- `REPONAME.git`: Automatically appended repository name

**Note**: The `--backup` flag is required to sync to backup locations. This allows GitSyncer to work normally even when backup servers are offline or unreachable.

## Project Showcase Generation

GitSyncer can generate a comprehensive showcase of all your projects using Claude AI. This feature creates a formatted document with project summaries, statistics, and code snippets.

### How it works

1. **Repository Analysis**: GitSyncer analyzes all cloned repositories to extract:
   - Programming languages and their usage percentages
   - Commit history and development activity
   - Lines of code and documentation
   - License information
   - Latest release version and date
   - AI-assistance detection (looks for CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md files)

2. **AI-Powered Summaries**: Uses Claude AI to generate concise project descriptions that explain:
   - What the project does
   - Why it's useful
   - How it's implemented
   - Key features and architecture

3. **Automatic Features**:
   - Extracts README images (including SVG support)
   - Selects representative code snippets
   - Orders projects by recent activity
   - Generates overall portfolio statistics
   - Caches summaries to avoid redundant AI calls

### Usage

```bash
# Generate showcase (uses cached summaries when available)
./gitsyncer --showcase

# Force regeneration of all summaries
./gitsyncer --showcase --force
```

### Output

The showcase is generated in Gemini Gemtext format and includes:
- Overall statistics (total projects, commits, lines of code, languages)
- Release status breakdown (released vs experimental projects)
- AI-assistance statistics
- Individual project sections with:
  - Language breakdown
  - Development metrics
  - Latest release information or experimental status
  - Project description
  - Code snippet example
  - Links to repositories

### Configuration

The showcase output is written to `~/git/foo.zone-content/gemtext/about/showcase.gmi.tpl` by default (currently hardcoded).

Projects can be excluded from the showcase by creating a `.nosync` file in their repository root.

## Example Workflows

### Automated weekly synchronization
The `--batch-run` feature is designed for automated weekly synchronization from cron jobs or shell scripts:

1. Add to your crontab or shell profile:
   ```bash
   # Run daily - gitsyncer will only execute once per week
   0 2 * * * /path/to/gitsyncer --batch-run
   ```

2. On each run, GitSyncer will:
   - Check if a week has passed since the last batch run
   - If yes: Execute full sync (--full) and showcase generation (--showcase)
   - If no: Skip execution and show when the last run occurred
   - Save the timestamp to `.gitsyncer-state.json` in your work directory

3. Benefits:
   - Prevents excessive API usage
   - Can be safely called daily/hourly without worry
   - Maintains weekly sync cadence automatically
   - Shows state file location for debugging

### Sync specific repositories
1. Create repositories on all platforms (GitHub, Codeberg, etc.)
2. Add the repository name to your `gitsyncer.json`
3. Run `./gitsyncer --sync repo-name`
4. GitSyncer will:
   - Clone from the first organization
   - Push all branches to other organizations
   - Keep them in sync going forward

### Sync all public Codeberg repositories
1. Ensure Codeberg is in your organizations list
2. Run `./gitsyncer --sync-codeberg-public`
3. GitSyncer will:
   - Fetch all public repositories from your Codeberg account
   - Sync each one to all other configured organizations
   - Skip any that fail (e.g., don't exist on other platforms)

## Error Handling

- **Merge conflicts**: GitSyncer will detect conflicts and exit with an error message
- **Missing repositories**: Must be created manually on all platforms
- **Missing branches**: Automatically created on remotes that don't have them
